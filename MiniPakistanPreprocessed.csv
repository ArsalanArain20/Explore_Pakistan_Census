It also has its share of 65% in generating the national revenue that includes federal and provincial taxes, customs and surcharges. In 2007, Karachi was identified as the most business-friendly city in Pakistan by World Bank.

The city has a very large and diverse economy. It is home for some of the largest and most dynamic industrial complexes in the country such as Sindh Industrial & Trading Estate (SITE), Korangi Industrial & Trade Estate, FB Area, North Karachi Industrial & Trade Estate, Dhabeji and Port Qasim etc. SITE Manghopir is the largest industrial park of the country comprising about 4000 factories.

Total land area of the city is 404 sq. Km. Altitude of the city lies between 31-15 and 31-45 North latitudes and 74-01 and 74-39 East longitude. Climate of Lahore city faces extremes climate, May, June, and July are hottest months. While December, January and February are the coldest months. Languages spoken in the city are Punjabi, Urdu and English. Extravagant language, maybe, but admirers have always vied with each other to immortalize this Pearl of the Punjab.

The origin of Lahore can be traced back somewhere between 1st and 7th centuries A.D. It is, however, inferred by historians that Lahore was actually founded by Loh e son of Rama, characterized as the Hindu god in Ramayana. According to Sir Robert Montgomery, Lahore rose to importance between 2nd and 4th centuries. According to the Greek geographer, Ptolemy, Lahore was founded somewhere at the end of the 1st century. According to the book ood-e-Aalamahore appeared as a town in 882 AD.

Lahore is the city of poets, artists and the center of film industry. It has the largest number of educational institutions in the country and some of the finest gardens in the continent.

Lahore is the second largest financial hub of Pakistan and has industrial areas including Kot Lakhpat and the new Sundar Industrial Estate (near Raiwand). A major industrial agglomeration with about 9,000 industrial units, Lahore has shifted in recent decades from manufacturing to service industries. The city is the country’s largest software producing center, and hosts a growing computer-assembly industry. (ADB 2010)

2,Faisalabad,31.418,73.079,Punjab,"The Faisalabad district is surrounded on the North and West by Hafizabad, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh districts respectively. In the East it touches Sheikhupura and in the South it is bounded by river Ravi, across which lies Okara.

A tiny town founded only to act as an agricultural market/mandi has now grown into a giant size metropolitan city, which enjoys third position in the country, as far as population and industrial growth is concerned. The present Faisalabad district came into existence in 1904 as Lyallpur district. Earlier, it was a Tehsil of Jhang district. During the later part of the 19th century, the Government of India initiated a great system of artificial irrigation through construction of canals.
The area of Faisalabad district was part of three districts via Gujranwala, Jhang and Sahiwal. This area was located between river Ravi and River Chenab and formed part of Rachna Doab. The name Lyallpur was given with a view to pay tribute to Sir James Lyall, Lt. Governor of Punjab, for his services rendered in colonization of the lower Chenab valley.
The design of the town was prepared by Captain Pophan Young C.I.E, a colonization officer. In 1896, Lyallpur tehsil comprised of Gujranwala, Jhang and Sahiwal and was under the administrative control of district Jhang.
The soil is fertile but salinity and water logging affect some areas. Major crops and fruits of district Faisalabad are wheat, sugarcane, rice, maize, citrus, guava and mangoes. A variety of vegetables are also grown in the district. 

Faisalabad district has made rapid strides in the field of industry after independence. It is now called the ""Manchester of Asia"" for its extensive development of textile industry. This development has been made possible by the continued efforts of pioneering entrepreneurs as well as workers over a period of four decades. Before independence, there were only five industrial units in Faisalabad City (then Lyallpur). Now, there are dozens of textile mills with other subsidiary units. Roughly, there are 512 large Industrial units, out of which 328 are Textile units, 92 engineering units and 92 of chemicals and food processing units. Other industries include hosiery, carpet and rugs, nawar and lace, printing and publishing and pharmaceutical products etc. There are also some 12,000 house-hold industries, which include some 60,000 power loom factories.

In 1947 there were 4 big Floor Mills, one Textile Mill, 12 Ginning units and 6 Engineering units. A few other industrial units also existed at that time. After independence, the large-scale migration of population, which included skilled workers and entrepreneurs, adversely affected the industrial set up. The government support also encouraged the entrepreneurs considerably, which resulted in rapid industrialization mostly in the textile sector.
An Industrial estate on Sargodha Road has been developed by Punjab Small Industrial Corporations (PSIC) over as area of 244 acres. Establishment of Industry in the estate is highly convenient because of availability of all the infra-structure through the PSIC.

Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a very strong and recognized chamber, which functions for the improvement and betterment of the business and industrialists community. The Chamber also gives suggestions to Federal Finance, Commerce Ministry, Provincial Finance, Excise and Taxation Ministry and Central Board of Revenue in formulating budget proposals or tax recovery proposals.
Besides Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, there are number of other industrial associations each related to different sector of Industry or business. The role of these associations is similar to the role of Chamber but restricted to the sector concerned and relatively confined to lower tiers of the government.
The important Associations contributing to the Industrial growth are appended below:

3,Rawalpindi,33.6007,73.0679,Punjab,"Rawalpindi is a city in the Potwar Plateau near Islamabad, the current capital of Pakistan. It is the military headquarters of the Pakistan Armed Forces and also served as the nation's capital while Islamabad was being constructed in the 1960s. The city is home to many industries and factories.
Islamabad International Airport is actually in Rawalpindi, and it serves the city along with the capital. Rawalpindi is located in the Punjab province, 275 km (171 miles) to the north-west of Lahore. It is the administrative seat of the Rawalpindi District. Rawalpindi, also known as Pindi, has a long history spread over several millennia. Archaeologists believe that a distinct culture flourished on this plateau as far back as 3000 years.
The material remains found at the site prove the existence of a Buddhist establishment contemporary to Taxila, but less celebrated than its neighbor. It appears that the ancient city went into oblivion as a result of the Hun devastation. The first Muslim invader, Mahmud of Ghazni (979-1030), gifted the ruined city to a Gakkhar Chief, Kai Gohar. The town, however, being on an invasion route, could not prosper and remained deserted until Jhanda Khan, another Gakkhar Chief, restored it and named it Rawalpindi after the village Rawal in 1493.
Rawalpindi remained under the rule of the Gakkhars till Muqarrab Khan, the last Gakkhar ruler, was defeated by the Sikhs in 1765. The Sikhs invited traders from other places to settle here. This brought the city into prominence. Following the British conquest of the Sikhs and their occupation of Rawalpindi in 1849, the city became a permanent garrison of the British army in 1851. In the 1880s a railway line to Rawalpindi was laid, and a train service was inaugurated on January 1, 1886. The need for having a railway link arose after Lord Dalhousie made Rawalpindi the headquarters of the Northern Command and Rawalpindi became the largest British military garrison in British India.
In 1951, Rawalpindi saw the murder of the first elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan, in Liaquat Garden. Today Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani Army and Air Force. The famous Murree Road has been a hot spot for various political and social events. Nala Lai, famous for its floods, runs in the middle of the city, dividing it into city area and Cantonment area. History describes Nala Lai water pure enough to do washing clothes but now it has become polluted with the waste water from all sources including factories and houses. It is rapidly developing into a large modern city. It has many good hotels, restaurants, clubs, museums, playgrounds. It has a number of parks, of which the largest is Ayub National Park. Rawalpindi is the nearest major city for the holiday resorts and hill stations of the Galiyat area, such as Murree, Nathia Gali, and Ayubia. It is also a common starting point for tourists visiting Abbottabad, Swat, Kaghan, Gilgit, Hunza, Skardu and Chitral.
The economy of Rawalpindi has a diverse industrial base. The main industries of the city include oil refineries, gas processing, steel manufacturing, iron mills, railroad yards, a brewery , sawmills, tent factories, textiles, hosiery, pottery, leather goods production, transport and tourism.",5285,312292.393,888765,7,174,5405633.0,1023.0,103.0,2875516,2530117,2741872,2663075,686,254000,0.032,3645.0,998897,17,3322,540,95.0,100.0,47.0,18.0,95.0,1203,314,370,67.95,92.25,99.75,99.75
4,Gujranwala,32.15,74.1833,Punjab,"The district lies in between two main cities, in North is the Gujrat and in South, there are Sheikhupura and Lahore. The Chenab river forms the Northern boundary of the district. Beyond the river, it is bounded by Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin districts, on the East by Sialkot district, on the South by Sheikhupura district and on the West by Hafizabad district.

Rice, Wheat and Sugarcane are the main crops grown in the district. The source of irrigation is perennial and non perennial canals supplemented by tub wells. Rice and Wheat are major food crops while Rice dominates with an earning of about Rs.15 millions as foreign exchange. Besides, Jawar, Bajra, Mash, Moong, Masoor, Gram, Maize, Tobacco, Oil Seed such as Rape/Mustard and sunflower are also grown in minor quantities in the district
Guavas and Citrus are main fruits grown in the district. Besides, Peaches, Jaman and Banana are also grown in minor quantities in the district. The major vegetables grown in the district are Potatoes, Cauliflower, Turnip, Onion, Peas, Carrot, Tomato, Ladyfinger and Garlic. Besides, Bitter Gourd and Chillies are also grown in the district in minor quantities.
The human settlements in Gujranwala existed since antiquity. The first name of the settlement according to the compilers of the first edition of the district gazette was Khanpur Shansi after an individual of the Jat tribe called Khan Shansi who founded 11 villages in the nearby area. Gujjar also settled in the Gujranwala region. They reach such dominance that the town came to be known as Gujranwala. It seems likely that the district once contained the capital of the Punjab, at an epoch when Lahore had not begun to exist.
We learn from the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hsuan Tsang, that about the year 630 A.D. he visited a town known as Tse-kia (or Taki), the metropolis of the whole country of the five rivers. A mound near the modern village of Asarur has been identified as the site of the ancient capital. Until the Muslim rule little is known of Gujranwala, except that Taki had fallen into oblivion and Lahore had become the chief city. ‘Under Muslim rule the district flourished for a time; but a mysterious depopulation fell upon the tract, and the whole region seems to have been almost entirely abandoned. The Compilers of the district Gazetteer Gujranwala date this name to Approximately 300 years, giving us a rough estimate of the middle of the 16th century. Other smaller town in the vicinity for example Sohdara Eminabad Wazirabad and Ghakhar have older antecedent than Gujranwala itself.
The Sikhs occupied the Punjab after the death of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir in 1707. Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the most powerful of all the Sikh rulers and ruled over for 40 years. After his death in 1840 the Sikh Empire was divided and disintegrated. The area was conquered and annexed by the British in 1849. A railway line was built along Grand Trunk Road in 1881. That railway line interconnected Gujranwala with other cities of Punjab and made the commercial trade between cities more convenient. British ruled the city until Pakistan's independence in 1947.
After independence Gujranwala was developed and it is now leading city of Pakistan. It is now an agricultural marketing center (grains, melons, sugarcane); it is also a commercial and industrial center, manufacturing ceramics, iron safes, copper, brass, and aluminum utensils. The establishment of an industrial park, textile, silk, pipefitting, electric fan, and tannery production increased its importance. Cultivation in the surrounding area is dependent upon canal irrigation. Wheat, cotton, rice, barley, and millet are the chief crops. One of the best quality Rice grows in Gujranwala.
In 1951, the city was converted into the capital of the district, which gave rise to the new industries in the city. The Gujranwala hydroelectric project provides power from the Chenab River. There are also rice and sugar mills and glassworks in the locality. City has an International Level Cricket Stadium, Jinnah Stadium also or formerly known as Municipal Stadium.
Gujranwala district is one of the major industrially developed district of the country. It possesses the requisite social/physical infrastructure and industrial base for the manufacture of specialized electrical/electronic products and industrial machinery to meet the overall requirement of the country such as distribution/power transformer, electricity/gas/water meters, circuit breakers, electric appliances, wires/cables, calculators, computers, machine tools, etc.",3622,4368.728,747214,5,166,5014196.0,1384.0,102.0,2948936,2065260,2533117,2480828,251,168000,0.064,2869.59,747144,16,1689,501,100.0,98.0,9.0,0.0,97.0,1085,302,258,79.27,96.26,99.63,99.18

Peshawar's economic importance has historically been linked to its privileged position at the entrance to the Khyber Pass – the ancient travel route by which most trade between Central Asia and the Indian Subcontinent passed.

Peshawar's Industrial Estate on Jamrud Road is an industrial zone established in the 1960s on 868 acres. The industrial estate hosts furniture, marble industries, and food processing industries, though many of its plots remain underutilized. The Hayatabad Industrial Estate hosts 646 industrial units in Peshawar's western suburbs, though several of the units are no longer in use. As part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor 4 special economic zones are to be established in the province, with roads, electricity, gas, water, and security to be provided by the government. 

On the whole, the economy of Peshawar is currently based on vast variety of economic sectors, among them are Agriculture, Horticulture, Manufacturing, Services, Pharmaceutical Sector. In Particular, Peshawar already is Manufacturing, Services and Pharmaceutical Hub of the province, but there is room to grow even more.

Quetta was granted the status of district in 1975. The name originates from Pushto word Kawatta, which means a fort. Formerly, the town was situated within the walls of fort “A Miri”, which is now used as an arsenal. Quetta is the provincial capital of Balochistan, sharing its boundaries in the east with Ziarat and in the west with Killa Abdullah. Pishin is in the north
and Mastung District lies in the south.

Locally, Quetta is also known by its ancient name of Shal or Shalkot based on its location at the north end of the Shal Valley about 1,690 meters above sea level. Although a small city, Quetta has over the years acquired the typical hustle and bustle of a provincial metropolis. The city and cantonment continue to modernize at an equally fast pace. Quetta is attractive to tourists for its thrilling location, full of adventure and enjoyment. Some prominent bazaars of Quetta are located on the roads Shahrah-e-Iqbal (the Kandahari bazaar) Shahrah-e-Liaquat (the Liaquat and Suraj Gang Bazaar, and Alamdar Road (little Tokyo).

In the provincial capital, mining concessions are granted for Coal, which is the major mineral. Limestone, Ordinary stone, Marble, Fluorite, Clay are other minerals; whereas, occurrences of Glass Sand, Dolomite, Silica (sand) are also reported. Sor range-Degari-Sinjidi-Pir Ismail Ziarat/Marwar Coal fields are well known in District Quetta. These coal deposits were identified in 1891 with 61 million ton of reserves. Coal is found at 28 Km east and south-east from Quetta. It is sub-bituminous in quality and contains low proportions and sculpture contents. Quetta is the nearest railway station for the Sor range, Spez and, Degari & Pir Ismail Ziarat coal fields, which have depth of 1,100 meters.

Pir Ismail Ziarat is 60 Km east of Quetta and covered over 20 square kilometers having two seams- upper and lower seams, while their thickness ranges between 0.6-0.7 meters and 0.4-0.45 meters respectively; while, their depth ranges between 200-1,000 meters. These fields are the major coal producing area of the country where besides Coal, Limestone, Fluorite and Ordinary stone is produced in significant quantity. Fluorite mineralization in Quetta District occurs in Chiltan Limestone of Jurassic age. Fluorite occurs in veins in fracture zones. Several hundred meters thick Limestone at places Dolomite occurs in Chiltan formation of Jurassic age in Quetta (Brewery Gorge)

Quetta is a trade route leading to Afghanistan and Iran therefore; it is a transit route between these countries. Trade takes place legally as well as illegally (smuggling). From Afghanistan, fresh as well as dry fruit, timber, cotton, sheep and goat skins are imported into Pakistan. Similarly from Iran, petrol, blankets, plastic goods, carpets, dried fruit, hosiery goods, and fresh fruit e.g. cherries and tinned fruits come into the country. Veterinary medicines and medicines for human consumption are smuggled into Quetta. The magnitude of import can be gauged from the number of trucks coming into Pakistan. It should be remembered that transit trade to India also takes place via Quetta. 

A greater proportion of trading activities is not possible to be documented due to the illegal nature of the trade. Normally food items particularly wheat, ugar and edible oil are smuggled to Afghanistan, while a number of products of Afghan origin and merchandised items of foreign origin are smuggled into Quetta District via Chaman. Adverse economic effects of these activities result in shortage of wheat and edible oil etc. in Quetta and adjoining districts. Foreign goods are available at cheaper rates, discouraging industrial development. The retail trade has flourished over the years, due to smuggling.",2653,85547.0,276711,3,67,2275699.0,650.01,110.37,1001205,1274494,1193913,1081755,31,11244,0.213,1958.0,328713,8,2265,957,92.0,100.0,71.0,69.0,98.0,445,96,96,50.98,20.04,29.4,37.19

The irrigated tract is higher than the riverain area. Most of the land has been brought under cultivation. The desert area is known as Cholistan. It extends along the entire Eastern boundary of Bahawalnagar district in the North and Rahim Yar Khan district in the South. The surface of the desert consists of a succession of sand dunes rising in places to a height of 150 metres.
Major crops and fruits of the district are cotton, wheat, sugarcane, dates, mangoes and citrus. At present, there are textile spinning mills, sugar mills, flour mills, cotton ginning/processing factories and oil expelling units in the district. There exists wide scope for cotton based industries i.e. textile spinning, weaving, processing/printing. More solvent oil extraction plants can be established as besides cotton seed, cotton oil cake and Mustard seeds can also be used as raw material. In addition, Dates based vinegar unit can also be established.

District Bahawalpur possesses forest area of about 15 thousand acres. Therefore, there exists a good prospect for wood seasoning/processing units and modern furniture units.

The district is linked with Lodhran, Bahawalnagar Vehari and Rahim Yar Khan Districts through metalled road. The main Peshawar-Karachi railway line passes through Bahawalpur District. The district is linked with Rahim Yar Khan, Hasilpur and Lodhran through railway network. The sub soil water in the district is suitable for industrial purposes. Since most of the industrial activity consists of cotton ginning and oil mills, no serious effluent disposal problems exist at present. However, if some effluent generating industries are established in the district then effluent can be discharged into river with permission from Irrigation and Power Department, Government of the Punjab. There are 11 grid stations in the district (ranging in capacity from 66 KV to 220 KV).  Natural gas is available in Ahmedpur East, Uch-Sharif, Khanqah-Sharif and Bahawalpur City.

Harrapa is today a large village in the Sahiwal District of Punjab, 15 miles southwest of the district town. Archaeologists think that ancient Harappa was the urban center dominating the upper Indus region, much like Mohenjo-daro dominated the lower Indus Valley and Ganweriwala might have been the urban center for what is now Rajasthan. The site at Harappa was first briefly excavated by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1872-73, two decades after brick robbers carried off the visible remains of the city. He found an Indus seal of unknown origin.
The first extensive excavations at Harappa were started by Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni in 1920. His work and contemporaneous excavations at Mohenjo-daro first brought to the world's attention the existence of the forgotten Indus Valley civilization as the earliest urban culture in the Indian subcontinent. His work was followed later in the decade by that of Madho Sarup Vats, also of the Archaeological Survey of India. Excavations by other archaeologists continued in the 1930's, and in 1946 Sir Mortimer Wheeler excavated the so-called fortification walls and found the first pre-Indus Valley civilization (Kot Dijian) deposits. After independence in 1947 and coming in District Sahiwal of Province of Punjab, Pakistan, Harappa was excavated by Mohammed Rafique Mughal of the Archaeological Survey of Pakistan in 1966.

55,Haripur,33.9942,72.9333,Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,"The strategic importance of the district is revealed from the fact that it has facilitated military campaigns as well as trade flow. Starting from 1399 A.D., the Turk King Taimur during his return to Kabul stationed his soldiers in the region to protect the Kabul to Kashmir route. Later on during the rule of Mughals, the same region continued to provide main route to Kashmir. Though the local tribe Tareen under the patronage of Ahmed Shah Durrani started ruling the area in the 18th century but lost their control to Sikhs in the beginning of the 19th century. It was in 1822 when the Hari Singh Nalwa, a Sikh General of the Ranjit Singh’s army founded the present day’s . The district is hence named after the founder, which means the village of Hari.

Due to these industries this district is playing an important role at the national level in economic development.

Since Haripur has developed situation of medium and big industries, its role in the agricultural field is also admirable.

King asked to arrange some water, there was no water, but Sarmast called up the grazing deer and milked to serve the King. King drank the milk and thanked Sarmast and asked if he had any wish or desire. Faqir Sarmast asked to build a town for his followers. King promised and ordered his advisor Hafiz Meerak to construct and build a city.

The district is bounded in the north by Hyderabad, in the east by Mirpurkhas and Tharparker districts, in the south by the Arabian Sea and Rann6 of Kutch, which also forms the international boundary with India, and in the west it borders Thatta and Hyderabad districts. The district is part of the Lower Indus Plain formed by the alluvial deposits of the Indus River. Thus, its land is very uniform in character and hills or rivers do not diversify it; in fact, there are no rivers or streams in the district. The climate of Badin is relatively mild. The sea breezes keep the summers relatively cool. During the monsoon period the sky is cloudy, but there is very little precipitation. The climate in summer is generally moist and humid. The cold weather in Badin starts from the beginning of November, where there is a sudden change in temperature. There are very few plants other than trees and grasses in the region.” (Human Development Foundation).

Badin district can be broadly divided into two distinct economic zones. One zone supports purely agricultural income and the other one has a mixed economy, having fisheries along with agriculture as its main stay. The upper part of the district, comprising of Taluka Tando Bago, Matli and Talhar, falls in the first zone whereas, Taluka Golarchi (Shaheed Fazil Rahoo) and Badin up to Taluka Diplo of district Tharparker constitutes the mixed economic zone. At present, sugarcane is the major cash crop in the district. However, after 2003 floods, due to shortage of water, the cultivation pattern changed and people have started growing sunflower as an alternate crop. The entire land is irrigated by water coming from Sukkur and Kotri barrages. The irrigation network mainly comprises Gooni, Phulali, Akram Wah and Nasir canals.

Bulk of the population resides in rural areas of which 65 percent is engaged in farming and livestock rearing, and depends on these as their main sources of livelihood17. While the farming sector provides a major source of employment for the people in District Badin, land ownership is much skewed. There are either large cultivators/absentee landlords or very small cultivators (mainly small owners-cum tenants and sharecroppers) or labourers. For majority of the population most agriculturally related income comes from labour on other people's farms, which easily outweighs income from crop sales. Main Crops are Sugar Cane, Rice, Wheat and sunflower.

There are six Sugar Mills and 70 Rice Husking mills in the district. The industry provides employment to 6,000 people. The sugarcane prices are unstable in Badin and industrialists never miss an opportunity to deny farmers their due share. During crop season, the net take home decreases drastically when the crop is bumper and the industry is not scared of the supply.",6726,120053.18,359376,5,68,1804516.0,268.0,107.0,390378,1414138,932488,871979,49,315000,0.433,1526.0,1856,4,170,326,100.0,100.0,33.0,5.0,82.0,2820,101,70,30.61,27.65,42.42,52.88
66,Rajanpur,29.1041,70.3297,Punjab,"Rajanpur District derives its name from the town of Rajanpur which was founded by Makhdoom Sheikh Rajan Shah about 1770. Rajanpur District was carved out from Dera Ghazi Khan District in 1982. Rajanpur is situated on the right bank (west side) of River Indus. It is bounded on the north by Dera Ghazi Khan District, to the west by Dera Bugti district of Balochistan, to the east by Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts, in the south lies Kashmore District of Sindh Province. The Suleiman Mountains rise to the west of the district.

The Vedic period is characterized by Indo-Aryan culture that invaded from Central Asia and settled in Punjab region. The Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Madras, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas and Kurus invaded, settled and ruled ancient Punjab region. After overrunning the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander marched into present-day Punjab region with an army of 50,000. The Rajanpur was ruled by Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and Shahi kingdoms.
In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region.
After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh Empire invaded and occupied Rajanpur District. The Muslims faced restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of British rule, Rajanpur district increased in population and importance.
The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Rajanpur District.
Agriculture in Rajanpur depends solely upon canal irrigation since rainfall is negligible in the region. The five rivers of the Punjab meet at the locality of Wang near Mithankot; hence these rivers provide water for irrigation as well as for domestic usage. Rainfall occurs during the monsoon season (July–September). Occasional heavy rainfall causes flooding in this region, but such floods are rare. In Rajanpur, flood waters come from the Kah Sultan and Shacher torrents (rivulets), as well as the Indus.
Rajanpur district is famous for cotton and sugarcane crop, although they are cultivating wheat and rice as well and tobacco to very little extent too.

The industrial sector of Rajanpur hosts a number of industries complementing its agricultural sector. There are many rice mills and numerous cotton ginning factories. Sugar and textile mills have also been set up for easy transport of raw material to factories.",12318,34685.427,262490,4,69,1995958.0,162.0,106.0,337202,1658756,1028015,967878,65,367000,0.357,1418.84,30474,6,334,199,100.0,100.0,27.0,9.0,51.0,966,86,69,66.97,68.66,98.69,97.17

Pishin was separated from Quetta after granting district status on 18 January, 1975. According to the local verbal accounts, its name originates from a son of the Emperor Afrasiab and Fushing was the spelling used in the records of the Afghan government. Pishin is a modernized form of 'Pushang', which is an Old Persian version of the Arabic name 'Fushang'. Pishin is also the name of an important town in the district. The district is located in the north of the Quetta City, the provincial capital of Balochistan, sharing its boundaries in the north-east with Afghanistan and Killa Saifullah in the east. Killa Abdullah on the west and Quetta District is in the south. The district is comprised of a series of valleys with ground elevation ranging from 1,370–1,680meters above Mean Sea Level, which are enclosed by Toba Kakar Range to the north. Lora River and its tributaries serve as major source meandering through Pishin.

Rabi crops include Wheat, Barley, Cumin, Vegetables and Fodder. Kharif Crops include fruits, Melons, Vegetables, Tobacco, Potato, Fodder and onion. Pishin is unique in the sense, that, it is also the major Tobacco producing district of Balochistan, although Tobacco economically not very important as compared to fruit production. Apples and Grapes are the leading fruits of the district.

District Pishin has substantial potential for mining of Chromite. Although, the Chromites is of high to low grade attribute. The out crop of ultramafic rocks in the area is connected with the main out crops of Muslim Bagh by inter mitten exposures. These ultramafic rocks are spreading over19 Square Kilometer long while 1/2 square kilometer wide area. Serpentinized dunite is the predominate rocks. The ultramafic rocks have extensively been intruded by dolerite dykes and basalt. Chromite has been classified in to three general grades i.e metallurgical, chemical and refractory. The deposits are pod form and small in size. There is occurrence of Dolomite, Soap Stone and Lateriate but exploitation on commercial scale has not been reported. The mineralization of very little Chromite, Quartz vein, Granite, Copper, Mica, Iron ore, Coal and minor minerals like Gravel, Sand and Clay etc, Chromite occurrence is wide spread in Khanozai area of Pishin District.

In Pishin, large manufacturing unit includes the only flour mill functional in the district. The small enterprises include Tobacco, R.C.C, ice, dairy farms and poultry farms which employ remarkable number of workers. Dairy farming and poultry farming is frequent in the area.

Since Pishin lies adjacent to Afghanistan, therefore smuggling takes place. Especially wheat, sugar and edible oil are smuggled into Afghanistan, while spices, dry fruit, skin, wool and a number of merchandised items of foreign origin are smuggled into Pishin. Due to smuggling trends people have lost interest in the industrial development of the district. In Pishin District, traditional handicrafts like embroidery work on dresses (kameez and shalwar) of children and women, on caps, on bed and pillow covers, etc. are very common. Women and girls do the embroidery work at home.

This desert is commonly known as Acchro Thar. The soil of the district, as a whole, is sandy with hard clay loams and some parts are desert. The average elevation of the area is about 50 meters above sea level.

agriculture is the main source of employment for the rural population, in the urban areas of the district people are engaged in various other economic activities like trade, services, personal business, and government and private jobs. Sanghar and Tando Jam are main trading centers of this district. Taluka Khipro, Jam Nawaz Ali, Sinjhoro and Sanghar are more dependent on agricultural activity as compared to Tando Adam and Shahdadpur. Though Tando Jam and Shahdadpur are also agro-based, here small industries also provide source of livelihood to the resident population.

Apart from well spread desert Achhro Thar in Khipro taluka, the remaining portion of district Sanghar is booming with agricultural activity and small industries. Sanghar contributes significantly in agriculture sector of Sindh because its climate is suitable for production of various crops including the Kharif crops of cotton, rice, jowar and sugarcane and the Rabi crops of wheat, gram and oil seeds. In addition to these, fruit orchards are abundant in this district. Taluka Shahdadpur and Tando Adam are famous for the production of a variety of fruits including banana, mango and dates. The fish of Jumrao canal is also another source of livelihood for the people of Sanghar district.

It was merged with Pakistan in 1969 and later on declared as a district in 1970. In 1996, it was bifurcated into Upper and Lower Dir districts. This district is situated in the northern part of Pakistan. It borders Chitral district and Afghanistan on the north and North West and Swat district to the east, and on the south by Lower Dir District.

People of Upper dir are not well educated but skilled in different fields such as agriculture, horticulture, technical work and industry. Labor in Upper dir is cheap and are easily available to producers which affects the production cost to produce goods at low cost. Majority of the populations is directly related to farming. The main crops grown in the valley are wheat, maize, rice, barley, potato, tomato and onion. In winters the young and energetic people migrate to big cities of the province or country in search of earning in different sectors. Other sources of income are fuel wood trade, daily wage labor, livestock production, gardening and electricity production through water. In Upper Dir there is no industrial sector and no business zone.

The Sarhad Development Authority has explored copper mineralization in the localities around Bekaray, Ala, Guma Dand and Barawal areas. The estimated reserves are around 4 million tones with 0.4 per cent copper. The reserves are very small to be exploited commercially.

Due to the long coastal line of 107 kilometers as well as shortage of river Indus water, the southwestern part of the district is saline and sea-affected. The southern portion, adjoining the Run of Kachh, on the border of India, is desert like sandy area. The northern part of this district consists of small hills and torrents that are extended till Kheerthar range of mountains.

Agriculture and fisheries are the two major sources of employment for the people of district Thatta. In addition to that, there is a substantial number of landless people who own and manage livestock or are engaged in the non-farm sectors.

Wheat, rice and sugarcane are major crops of this district. Official statistics about these major crops have shown surprising results i.e., over the last twenty years, area and production of these crops have significantly increased. 

The industrial units of the district include sugar mills, textile mills, paper mills, flour mills, salt works, ice factory, etc. In addition, crushed stones from the Makli Hills and Kohistan are supplied to the Pakistan Steel Mill and the Thatta Cement Factory. There are also large coal deposits in Thatta Taluka. Recent addition to the industrial units is the car manufacturing plant near Budho Talpur, belonging to the Deevan Group, adjacent to the Deewan Sugar Mills. Apart from the sugar mills, all the larger industrial units are located in Dhabeji and Gharo mouzas adjacent to Karachi. Most of the labour force working in these units is non-local and generally belongs to Karachi.

The name originates from Lorala, which is a stream that flows in the south of Loralai town. The district headquarter is in “Loralai” town. Loralai is located in the North-east of Balochistan, sharing its boundaries clockwise from North with Killa Saifullah, Zhob, Musakhel, Barkhan, Kohlu, Sibi and Ziarat Districts. 

The terrain of the district consists of east-west aligned mountains, valleys and southern plains ranging in ground elevation from 908-3,136 meters above MSL (Mean Sea Level). Loralai has been famous for its agriculture/ horticulture and livestock holdings. Almonds and apricots are popular across the country. Communications network of Loralai city is well established with radio station broadcasting, telephone exchange, and mobile communication services.

Location of Barkhan is at 541km (aerial distance) south-west (220 degrees bearing) of Pakistan's capital city Islamabad and 245 km east (97 degrees bearing) from Quetta City, the provincial capital of Balochistan.

Barkhan was granted the status of separate district on 31 December, 1991. The name “Barkhan” is said to be originated from an individual's name: Baron Khan. He was the founder of Barozai family of Pannis and who either owned this area himself or had been ruling on behalf of Governor of Sibi. The eastern boundary of District Barkhan demarcates Punjab and Balochistan. Barkhan shares its boundaries in the east with district Dera Bugti while districts of Loralai and Kohlu are on the western side and Musakhail District is in the north. The district's headquarter is in “Barkhan” town.

The major Rabi crop is Wheat, Vegetable production is very important and dominant in Barkhan. Almond, Apple, Apricot, Peach, Plum, Grapes and Pomegranate are the leading fruits produced in District Barkhan.

In Balochistan, industrial development started after 1970 when Provincial Government developed some Industrial Estates because of availability of raw material such as minerals, agricultural crops, fruits, vegetables and fish. Industrialization is considered as key to achieving rapid economic development besides reducing poverty. There are no significant industrial establishments in the district except one registered flour mill which employs more than 10 regular workers. The district is devoid of any substantial manufacturing units and large industries. There are some small enterprises employing very few workers. The labor employed in the manufacturing and industrial sectors are all paid males. Females are involved only in handicraft which is not a formal part of industries in the district.

Traders and shopkeepers deal in almost all sorts of goods as trade is conducted on retail bases. Most of the items are made bypesh (dwarf palm) which include ban, ropes, mats and which are exported to Dera Ghazi Khan and other trade centers in Punjab province.
